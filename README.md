# Low-Income-LLM-Project
### Large Language Models W/ Python Coding 
In this project, I rebuilt a Large Language Model (LLM) from my emerging technology class to support low-income families. LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on vast text data to generate human-like responses, providing natural, contextually relevant guidance. This model offers accessible information, personalized advice, and key insights, helping to bridge service gaps, improve resource access, and empower families to enhance their economic and social well-being. Additionally, it provides policymakers with valuable insights for more effective interventions.
